            <p>Before going to training with jiraiya,Naruto's best firend Sasuke Uchiha leaves the Hidden leaf village to gain power from Orochimaru(evil guy) as he wanted revenge from his older brother as he killed his whole clan and just spared Sasuke</p>
            <h3><b>About Naruto Shippuuden(Anime)</b></h3>
            <p>When he returns back from his training to the Hidden Leaf village he eats his favourite food, Ramen.Later on an evil organisation known as the Akatsuki's try to capture naruto as he was the nine-tails host(Akatsuki wanted all the tailed beasts for "True Peace")but they failed </p>
            <br>
            <p>Naruto was training to make his own special jutsu called the RasenShuriken to get stronger and bring back Sasuke.Few days later Naruto master's his RasenShuriken and Kakashi and Naruto kill an Akatsuki member called <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Kakuzu?so=search" target="_blank">Kakuzu</a> as Kakuzu tried to capture Naruto </p>
            <br>
            <p>After the fight with Kakuzu Kakashi gets injured but they knew where Sasuke was but Kakashi was injured so Naruto and Sakura could not go to bring back Sasuke,but Kakashi knew a friend called <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Yamato?so=search" target="_blank">Yamato</a> so Yamato replaced Kakashi for that mission only and the 5th Hokage gave another shinobi to there team,called <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Sai?so=search" target="_blank">Sai</a>.When they met Sasuke they were not able to succeed their mission as they were too weak</p>
            <br>
